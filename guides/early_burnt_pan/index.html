				I went crazy trying to figure out how to do the Burnt Pan glitch.<br>
				Here's a setup I picked up from speedrunning videos!<br>
			</h4>
			<h2><em>Note!</em></h2>
			<h4>
				Make sure you are on "old_version_101" beta.<br>
				This is just good for speedrunning in general.<br>
				<em>If you are doing a speedrun, use "old_version_101".</em>

				Glitch:
			</h1>

			<h3>Step 1:</h3>
			<h4>
				Enter Alphys' lab, and go right below the dog food.
			</h4>

			<h3>Step 2:</h3>
			<h4>
				Inch closer to the right by tapping right + C, until you can go up.
			</h4>

			<h3>Step 3:</h3>
			<h4>
				Once you are at the dog food, hold up-left. Then, still holding up-left, tap right and C.<br>
				If it worked, you should be facing left inside your menu, and you should've moved one step to the right.<br>
				(you may have to repeat step 3 one more time)
			</h4>

			<h3>Step 4:</h3>
			<h4>
				Still holding up-left, close your menu with X and tap Z to interact with the dog food. <br>
				The camera should pan over while the dog food dialogue is up.<br>
				You can now let go of up-left.
			</h4>
			<img src="./imgs/step4.png" width=500>

			<h3>Step 5:</h3>
			<h4>
				Mash Z and X to get out of the dog food dialogue while it's active.<br>
				While you can still move, go right next to the fridge.
			</h4>

			<h3>Step 6:</h3>
			<h4>
				Take your hand off of all movement keys, and go through Mettaton's dialogue<br>
				until he says "DECIDING NOT TO FIGHT YOU." (etc.)
			</h4>
			<img src="./imgs/step6.png" width=500>

			<h3>Step 7:</h3>
			<h4>
				While the textbox with "DECIDING NOT TO FIGHT YOU." is open,<br>
				hold left and tap Z. (you should see something like this)<br>
				Then, start holding right. <br>
				(or, keep holding left to get 2 packets of instant noodles!)
			</h4>
			<img src="./imgs/step7.png" width=500>
			<h3>Step 8:</h3>
			<h4>
				Mash through the text with Z and X whilst holding right,<br>
				then claim your well-earned prize!<br>
				"* (You got the Burnt Pan.)"<br>
				
			</h4>
